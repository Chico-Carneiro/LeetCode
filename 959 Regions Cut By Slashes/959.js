  I didn't even try today. I didn't have much time and after reading the Problem description
I had doubts about what was being asked.
In the discussion, many said this wasn't a Medium problem but a Hard one.
Therefore I decided it would be better to find time to read the Editorial.
As I read throught the Editorial, it still "blew my mind", mainly because of the set of skills
one needs to have in order to approach such a problem.
The major point I would like to take from this particular problem is how much "bolder" I need
to be from the start when approaching a problem like this, so I can intuitively abstract from the given
framing of the problem - including the given wording, data structures, examples, etc. - much sooner.
I am very creative, but it is true that I tend to approach these problems conservatively, trying to
use the given settings as much as possible, instead of going immediatelly for a completely reframing
of the concepts.
