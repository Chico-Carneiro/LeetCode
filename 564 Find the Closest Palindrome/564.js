I didn't have much time, nor patience tbh.
After a brief analysis, I got the overall idea, although I couldn't be sure without further exploration
. Find the midpoint,
. mirror the number,
. check for problems in the digit left to midpoint,
. check for problems in strings like "100", "1000", "10000", ...
I didn't get into the details, nor did I was sure there wouldn't exist any other edge cases.

On top of that, I was convinced I would need to implement string manipulation versions to perform comparisons,
which was going to take some time.

So I decided to just read the Editorial.
I wasn't very far from approach 1.
I can't understand approach 2, which uses binary search. I guess I'll try to read it again.
