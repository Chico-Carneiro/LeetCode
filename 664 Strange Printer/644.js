/*
I looked at the Problem, read the Discussion.
I don't have much time today, this is a hard problem.
I don't have any solid idea.
I feel that thinking about counting blocks of similar letters would be moving towards a strategy.
Ex: "aabbccbbffggaahhaallaa" => a: 4, b: 2, c: 1, f: 1, g: 1, h: 1, l: 1 
After spending so much time yesterday I will have to pass on this one.
I'll read the Editorial and hopefully learn something.
